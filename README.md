# Unified Base Stack Notes (2026 Transition)

Personal repo tracking the **Base L2** shift from OP Stack to the **Unified Base Stack** — announced February 18, 2026.

Base is moving to full control: own codebase, repos, upgrades — faster iteration (2× speed), simpler structure, tailored for massive scale, while staying Ethereum-secured (optimistic rollup).

Official blog: [Next Chapter for Base Chain](https://blog.base.dev/next-chapter-for-base-chain-1)  
Main repo now: [github.com/base/base](https://github.com/base/base) (Reth-based node + components)

## Why this matters (my take)
- Faster hard forks & features → better TPS, lower fees, smoother farming (Aerodrome loops, bridges, etc.)
- Independence from Optimism dependencies → Base owns its roadmap (good for long-term dominance)
- Still open-source & Ethereum L1 secured — no L1 pivot
- Potential boost for future token/incentives if TGE happens (Polymarket ~51% for 2026 end)

## Key Links
- Base Engineering Blog Post: https://blog.base.dev/next-chapter-for-base-chain-1
- Unified Repo: https://github.com/base/base
- Base Org: https://github.com/base
- Old OP Stack context: Optimism monorepo (now less relevant for Base core)

## Farming Context
- This stack change = positive for activity (more upgrades = more opportunities?)

## Planned Sections (WIP)
- Timeline of changes post-Feb 18, 2026
- Node running notes (if I spin one up)
- Implications for DeFi (Aerodrome, Aave, etc.)
- Token speculation tie-in (if revenue share comes)

Feel free to star/fork/discuss if you're following Base too!
